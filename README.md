# Mastodon Near Me -  Fediverse communities by country, region, and language
A curated map and data directory showcasing ActivityPub microblogging service providers, each catering to a certain locality or offering support in a notable language, and open for new registrations.

## Map 
The interactive map of the service providers is maintained at [mastodon-near.me](http://mastodon-near.me).  An accessible text version is available at [jaz.co.uk/projects/mastodon-near-me](https://jaz.co.uk/projects/mastodon-near-me/#data).

![A map of the world with markers for Mastodon servers in geographic areas](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3419832/229815849-9370631a-e986-4090-a18e-be2d5a8ce608.png)
### Purpose 
Geographic service providers often cater to users from specific regions or countries, including their diasporas, by supporting local languages. Those new to the fediverse can use the map (or the data tables below) to find servers focused on their community and language. This map highlights servers with a strong local user base and effective content moderation, aiding in the selection of a suitable provider. Additionally, many of these online services support endangered languages, helping to bridge the digital gap in language representation.

### Inclusion Criteria 
 - Mastodon or a Mastodon fork (other ActivityPub services may become in scope at a later date),
 - Open for registration (including approval required),
 - Clearly demonstrated intent to serve a particular facility (e.g. a university), neighbourhood, city, region or country; or a specific language or family of languages that can generally be thought of as being constrained to a particular locale or region or are minority/underserved languages,
 - Discernibly well-moderated,
 - HTTPS only,
 - Over 50 active members (hyper-local servers may have fewer MAU).
 
 ### Exclusion Criteria
  - Any server that clearly and overtly contravenes the Mastodon Server Covenant https://joinmastodon.org/covenant (public signing of the Mastodon Server Convenant is not required for inclusion),
  - Any server that is consistently unreachable.
